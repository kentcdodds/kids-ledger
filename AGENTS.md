We use bun for installing dependencies and running scripts. Do not use npm.

## Code style

- Read and follow `docs/agents/code-style.md` before writing code.
- Match the surrounding file style (quotes, semicolons, formatting).

## Agent setup

- Install dependencies with `bun install`.
- Apply local D1 migrations with `bun run migrate:local` before DB-backed tests.
- Copy `.env.test` to `.env` before running dev or tests.

## Verification before commit

- Run the Full Gate: `bun run validate`.
- Run formatting: `bun run format`.

## Documentation maintenance

- After completing code changes, update `docs/agents` when behavior, workflows,
  architecture notes, or verification guidance have changed.
- Treat documentation updates as part of done work so `docs/agents` stays
  current.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` concise and map-like; put detailed guidance in focused docs.
- When failures repeat, promote lessons from docs into tests, lint rules, or
  scripts so improvements compound.
