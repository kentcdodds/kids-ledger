# Setup manifest

This document describes the infrastructure and secrets that kids-ledger expects.

## Cloudflare resources

This project uses the following resources:

- D1 database
  - `database_name`: `<app-name>`
- KV namespace for OAuth/session storage
  - `binding`: `OAUTH_KV`
  - `title`: `<app-name>-oauth`

Production CI deploys now ensure these resources exist and create them when
missing. The post-download script does not create Cloudflare resources and does
not rewrite `wrangler.jsonc` resource IDs. Cloudflare deploys do not auto-create
these resources from bindings alone, so the deploy workflow runs
`bun tools/ci/production-resources.ts ensure` first.

## Optional Cloudflare offerings

The starter intentionally keeps the default footprint small. If you want to add
additional Cloudflare offerings (R2, Workers AI, AI Gateway, or a separate KV
namespace for app data), see:

- `docs/cloudflare-offerings.md`

## Rate limiting (Cloudflare dashboard)

Use Cloudflare's built-in rate limiting rules instead of custom Worker logic.

1. Open the Cloudflare dashboard for the zone that routes to your Worker.
2. Go to `Security` → `WAF` → `Rate limiting rules` (or `Rules` →
   `Rate limiting rules`).
3. Create a rule that targets auth endpoints, for example:
   - Expression:
     `(http.request.method eq "POST" and http.request.uri.path in {"/auth" "/oauth/authorize" "/oauth/token" "/oauth/register"})`
   - Threshold: `10` requests per `1 minute` per IP (tune as needed).
   - Action: `Block` or `Managed Challenge`.

## Environment variables

Local development uses `.env`, which Wrangler loads automatically:

- `COOKIE_SECRET` (generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`)
- `APP_BASE_URL` (optional; defaults to request origin, example
  `https://app.example.com`)
- `APP_COMMIT_SHA` (optional; set automatically by deploy workflows for
  version-aware `/health` checks)
- `RESEND_API_BASE_URL` (optional, defaults to `https://api.resend.com`)
- `RESEND_API_KEY` (optional, required to send via Resend)
- `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` (optional, required to send via Resend)

Tests use `.env.test` when `CLOUDFLARE_ENV=test` (set by Playwright).

## GitHub Actions secrets

Configure these secrets for GitHub Actions workflows:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (Workers deploy + D1 edit access on the correct
  account)
- `COOKIE_SECRET` (same format as local)
- `APP_BASE_URL` (optional, used by the production deploy)
- `RESEND_API_KEY` (optional, required to send via Resend in non-mock
  environments)
- `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` (optional, required to send via Resend)

How to get/set each secret:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
  - In Cloudflare Dashboard, create an API Token with permissions to deploy
    Workers and edit D1 on the target account.
  - In GitHub: `Settings` → `Secrets and variables` → `Actions` →
    `New repository secret`.
- `COOKIE_SECRET`
  - Generate locally: `openssl rand -hex 32`
  - Store the exact value as a repository secret in GitHub Actions.
- `APP_BASE_URL` (optional)
  - Use your production app URL (for example `https://app.example.com`).
  - Add only if you want deploy-time health/version checks to use a fixed URL.
- `RESEND_API_KEY` (optional)
  - Create in Resend Dashboard (API keys), then store in GitHub Actions secrets.
- `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` (optional)
  - Use your verified sender/from address in Resend (for example
    `noreply@example.com`), then store it as a secret.

Preview deploys for pull requests create a separate Worker per PR named
`<app-name>-pr-<number>` (for kids-ledger: `kids-ledger-pr-123`) plus one Worker per
mock service named `<app-name>-pr-<number>-mock-<service>`. The same
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` must be able to create/update and delete those Workers.
