npm run deploy

# Type checking
npm run typecheck
```

## Database Schema

The app uses a simple three-table schema:

- **ledgers**: Main ledger information
- **kids**: Children with emoji avatars and names
- **accounts**: Individual accounts for each kid with balances

All tables include automatic timestamps and sort order fields for drag-and-drop
functionality.

## Security & Privacy

- No user accounts or authentication required
- Ledger access is controlled by the unique URL
- Data is stored securely in Cloudflare D1
- No personal data is collected beyond what you enter

## Deploys

This project includes automatic PR preview deployments with isolated databases.
When you create a pull request:

1. **Automatic Deployment**: Each PR is automatically deployed to a temporary
   worker with the name `kids-ledger-pr-{PR_NUMBER}`
2. **Isolated Database**: Each PR gets its own temporary D1 database with the
   name `kids-ledger-pr-{PR_NUMBER}`, ensuring no interference with production
   data
3. **Preview URL**: You'll get a unique URL for each PR to test changes before
   merging
4. **Database Migrations**: The temporary database automatically runs all
   migrations when the worker starts up, ensuring the schema is up-to-date
5. **Automatic Cleanup**: When the PR is closed or merged, both the temporary
   worker and database are automatically cleaned up

The deployment workflow runs on:

- Push to main branch (production deployment)
- Pull request events (preview deployment with isolated database)
- Pull request closure (cleanup of worker and database)

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already
configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS
framework you prefer.
